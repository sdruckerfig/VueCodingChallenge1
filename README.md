# Vue Coding Challenge 1
Complete the challenge successfully and get a job offer.

The goal of the challenge is to help me understand how you think about and solve relatively complex problems using Vue.js and distinguish "advanced/senior" vue developers from their more junior counterparts. This challenge, in terms of level of difficulty, is far less difficult than some of the others that we've had to solve within our flagship application, Agrify Insights.

In order to successfuly complete the challenge you should use Vue 2.x and Vuetify 2.x to read the .json and dynamically construct the form as illustrated in figure1.png using generally accepted best-practices.

Changes to field values should automatically update fields with formulas that reference them as illustrated in demo.mp4. Changes to dependent values should be indicated visually.

You should be able to complete this exercise in less than 200 lines of custom code.
